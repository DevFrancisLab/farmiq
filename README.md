# FarmIQ – Smart Farming AI Assistant on ICP

**FarmIQ** empowers African farmers by providing smart, localized advice using AI. It combines weather, soil, and market data with the power of a large language model (LLM) on the Internet Computer (ICP) to help farmers make better decisions about crops, fertilizers, livestock, and farming practices.

Users can interact with the AI assistant directly from a chat interface, asking farming-related questions and receiving real-time, contextual answers powered by Motoko and React.
